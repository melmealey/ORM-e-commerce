## Description 
This is a backend application for an ecommerce site that uses Sequelize to interact with a Postgres or MySQL Database. Then, using insomnia, a user can interact with the backend to view the products, categories, and tags as well as use CRUD methods to alter the database.

## Installation
Cloned the starter code from here:
* https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella

* You will also need to npm install sequelize, express, dotenv and pg from the integrated terminal to interact with the database. After all the databases have been created you can run "npm run seed" to seed the database. To get the server up and running/ listening you will run "node server". 

## Usage
To use this application a user needs to start the server on local host then use an application like Insomina to make requests to the database

## Credits
